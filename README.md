Hospital System Network Design
Abstract 
This document outlines the design, implementation, and security measures of a new hospital 
network system aimed at improving efficiency, communication, and security. The project 
replaces the old paper-based system with a scalable, secure, and high-performance network 
architecture that supports the hospital’s operations, data flow, and communication needs. 
The report provides an in-depth analysis of the existing issues, proposed solutions, network 
design, and risk mitigation strategies, ensuring a secure and efficient IT infrastructure for the 
hospital. 
Introduction 
In modern healthcare institutions, seamless communication and secure data handling are 
critical to providing quality care and services. However, many hospitals still rely on outdated, 
inefficient systems that limit their ability to operate efficiently. This document presents a 
secure, efficient, and future-proof hospital network system designed to address these issues. 
The network design incorporates advanced features like VLANs, secure routing, and 
encryption to ensure data security, availability, and integrity across the hospital's different 
departments. 
Problem Statement 
The current hospital system lacks the necessary infrastructure to support secure and efficient 
communication between departments, leading to inefficiencies, delays in accessing medical 
records, and potential security vulnerabilities. The outdated paper-based system is prone to 
data loss and lacks redundancy, making it difficult to scale or secure sensitive patient 
information. This exposes the hospital to compliance risks, data breaches, and operational 
inefficiencies. 
Goals and Objectives 
The goal of this project is to design and implement a modern network system that: 
• Ensures secure communication between departments and external sites. 
• Supports encrypted and authenticated access to sensitive data. 
• Reduces downtime and improves the reliability of the hospital's IT infrastructure. 
• Increases operational efficiency through the implementation of VLANs and network 
segmentation. 
• Implements robust security measures, including firewalls, IPSec VPNs, ACLs, and 
physical security protocols.
